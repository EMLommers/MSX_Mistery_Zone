HOUWEEE !!......WELL HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS MUSIC ???? OK,OK IT IS MAYBE VERY
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER ONES YOU HEARD IN THIS DEMO, BUT WE LIKE IT A LOT
BECAUSE IT IS FUCKING LOUD AND SUPER FAST......
PROBABLY YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT THIS HEAVY HARDCORE MUSIC IS DOING IN THIS
DEMO....THE BE HONEST, I DON'T KNOW EIGHTER (JUST KIDDING).

IN FRONT OF ME SITS AN OLD DUDE AND HE KINDA LOOKS PISSED OFF....AND WHEN I
SAY PISSED OFF I REALLY MEAN TOTALLY PISSED OFF.....I WONDER WHY HE IS
LOOKING SO ANGRILY.....WHOOOOPS SORRY, LET ME FIRST EXPLANE THE SITUATION,
BEFORE YOU HTINK THAT I'M MAKING UP THIS STORY OF THAT I HAVE BEEN BLOWING.
TODAY IT IS MONDAY, JUST ANOTHER ORDINARY MONDAY, SO THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL
TO IT, TO BE EXACT IT IS THE 20TH OF MARCH.
I'M SITTING IN THE 07:36 TRAIN FROM ZUTPHEN TO ZWOLLE (AT DEVENTER I GET OFF),
JUST LIKE EVERY DAY, ACCEPT FOR FRIDAY, THEN I SIT IN THE TRAIN AT 09:36, BUT
THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT NOW.
OF COURSE YOU ALL KNOW HOW THOSE NS-TRAINS LOOK LIKE FROM THE INSIDE, YOU
HAVE THOSE NICE DUBBLE SEATS FACING EACHOTHER.....WELL I WAS SITTING ON ONE
OF THEM EN THE OLD MAN (YEAH THAT PISSED OFF ONE), WAS SITTING NEARLY
OPPOSITE ME.
MY FEET WERE LYING ON THE RIGHT OF HIM (FOR ME THEY WERE ON HIS LEFT) AND I
WAS ENJOYING MY SELFMADE SANDWICH (PEANUTBUTTER WITH JELLYBEANS), READING MY
FAVOURITE MAGAZINE (NO NOT THE PLAYBOY OR PENTHOUSE BUT THE MCCM !), LISTENING
TO MY WALKMAN (HARDCORE) AND NOW AND THEN I TOOK A NIP OFF MY DRINK.
YOU MUST BE THINKING "WHAT IS WRONG IN THIS PICTURE", WELL SO FAR I DONT
KNOW.....BUT WHAT WAS MAKING THIS MAN SO ANGRY ????
THE SANDWICH ?? NO I DON'T HTINK SO, IT TASTED ALLRIGHT SO THAT COULDN'T BE
THE PROBLEM.....
THE MAGAZINE ?? NOW WAY DUDE ! IT IS SIMPLY THE BEST...OR HAS THAT GUY MAYBE
GOT A COMMODORE ??
PERHAPS WAS MY WALKMAN PLAYING THE MUSIC A BIT TO LOUD....OK I WILL TURN THE
VOLUME A BIT DOWN.......NO THAT ALSO WASN'T IT, HE STILL LOOKS MEAN....
MAYBE MY FEET ARE SMELLING......NO THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE, LAST MONTH A PUT ON
A NEW PAIR OF SOCKS....
OK I GIVE UP....WHAT COULD IT BE ???
SNIF SNIF, OH MAN.....DAMN WHAT IS THAT TERRIBLE SMELL ?? IT SMELLS LIKE
SOMEONE IS DIEING INHERE..... WERE THE HELL IS THAT SMELL COMMING FROM ???
MAYBE FROM OUTSIDE ?? ARE THOSE FARMERS SPRAYING AGAIN ??
NOP.....OUTSIDE IT IS SMELLING VERY FRESH.....SNIF SNIF SNIF.....OH MY GOD !!
IT IS ME !!! I FARTED !! I SHOULDN'T HAVE EATEN THAT GOULASH FOR BREAKFAST !
WELL LUCKY ME, WE ARE ARRIVING IN DEVENTER, I HAVE TO GET OFF HERE......
.................PFFFFFF.....THAT WAS A DIRTY STORY !!..........THAT POOR OLD
MAN, HE ALMOST CHOKED IN THE TRAIN, THAT WAS ALMOST AS TERRIBLE AS WHAT
HAPPENED IN TOKIO TODAY......16 PEOPLE DIE IN THE METRO BY GASIFICATION !!
